# `patcher aka Snail2021`
This folder contains the program to modify the firmware updater with the modifications from the folder patches.
Because the firmware updater is only available for windows, this needs to be compiled and executed unter windows.

The executable is called Snail2021.exe because this is derived from my previous attempts to modify the firmware, where the program was called Snail2020.exe. I don't want to change this name, so the experience for users who just want to do this modification see the similarity of this programs when looking at just the file name.

If you want to compile Snail2021 from source, you need minGW under windows.
(You can always download the precompiled file Snail2021.zip which contains Snail2021.exe and the modifications precompiled, so you don't need Linux to compile the patches [in the folder /patches] )
