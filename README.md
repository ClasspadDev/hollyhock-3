An SDK to write your own applications for the CASIO fx-CP400 graphics calculator.

This is by no means a finished project. Like the disclaimer says, use at your own risk! Breaking changes are not out of the question, and should be 100% expected.

I (@The6P4C) have burned out *hard* on this project, and won't be maintaining it any further. These tools, patches and SDK work only for OS v02.01.2000.0000. The tools are easily updated, but the patches and SDK are **much** more difficult (and half the reason I'm so burned out).

Please contact @ps100000 regarding this project.
